## Overwrite Existing Text with Replace Mode

1. tip:

> Replace mode is identical to Insert mode, except that it overwrites existing text in the document. We can use `R` command to enter Replace mode.

2. snippet:

```text
Typing Insert mode extends the line,But in Replace mode the line length doesn't change.
```

type `f.`, then type `R,b<Esc>`.

3. more:

Vim has a second variant of Replace mode. Virtual Replce mode is triggered with `gR` and treats the tab character as though it consisted of spaces.

Vim also provides a single-shot version of Replace mode and Virtual Replace mode, `r{char}` and `gr{cahr}`.
