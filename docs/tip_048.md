## Move Word-Wise

1. tip

> Vim has two speeds for moving backward and forward word-wise. Both allow for a more rapid traversal than moving by one column at a time.

| Command | Move Cursor                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `w`     | Forward to start of next word              |
| `b`     | Backward to start of current/previous word |
| `e`     | Forward to end of current/next word        |
| `ge`    | Backward to end of previous word           |

2. more

Each word-wise we met earlier has WORD-wise euivalent, including `W`, `B`, `E`, and `gE`.

A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, or as a sequence of other nonblank characters separated with whitespace. The definition of a WORD is simpler: it consists of a sequence of nonblank characters separated with whitespace WORDS are bigger than words.

Use WORD-wise motions if you want to move faster, and use word-wise motions if you want a more fine-grained traversal.
