## Do Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations in Place

1. tip:

> The delete and yank commands allow us to set the contents of a register, while the put command allows us to get the contents of a register by inserting it into the document. The expression register is different. It is addressed by the = symbol.From Insert mode web can access it by typing `<C-r>=`.

2. snippet:

```text
6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $
```

we can type `<C-r>=6*35<CR>` at the end of line , and the result is:

```text
6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $210
```
