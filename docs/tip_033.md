# Tip 033

## Insert the Current Word at the Command Prompt

1. tip

> At Vim's command line, the `<C-r><C-w>` mapping copied the word under the cursor and inserts it at the command-line prompt. We can use this to save ourselves a bit of typing.
> Suppose that we want to rename the tally variable in this excerpt to counter:

2. snippet:

```js
var tally
for (tally = 1; tally <= 10; tally++) {
  // do something with tally
}
```

Press `*` key to search each occurrentce, then use `:%s//<C-r><C-w>` mapping to populate the replacement field.

3. more:

For more application, try opening your vimrc file, place your cursor on a setting, and the type `:help <C-r><C-w>` to look up the documentation for that setting.
