## Organize Your Window Layouts with Tab Pages

1. tip

> In Vim, a tab page is a container that can holder a collection of windows.
> When we open a file using the `:edit` command, Vim doesn't automatically create a new tab. Instead, it creates a new buffer and loads it into the current window.
> Suppose that we're at work on a project, with our workspace divided into a few split windows. Out of the blue, something urgent comes up and we have to switch contexts.
> Rather than opening new files in our current tab page, which would mess up our carefully assembled workspace, we can create a new tab page and do the work there.
> When we're ready to resume our previous work, we just have to switch back to the original tab page where all of our windows will have been preserved as we left them.

| Command               | Effect                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| :tabe[dit] {filename} | Open {filename} in a new tab                      |
| `<C-w>T`              | Move the current window into its own tab          |
| :tabc[lose]           | Close the current tab page and all of its windows |
| :tabo[nly]            | keep the active tab pge, closing all others       |
| {N}gt                 | Switch to tab page number {N}                     |
| gt                    | Switch to the next tab page                       |
| gT                    | Switch to the previous tab page                   |

We can use the `:tabmove[N]` Ex command to rearrange tab pages. When [N] is 0, the current tab page is moved to the beginning, and if we omit [N], the current tab page is moved to the end.
