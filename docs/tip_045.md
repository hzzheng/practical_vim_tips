## Save a File as the Super User

1. tip

>  Running Vim as the super user isn't normal, but sometimes we have to save change to a file that requries sudo permission. We can do so without restarting Vim by delegating the task to a shell process and running that with sudo.

2. more

We can open the file `/etc/hosts` in Vim as user drew.

```
vim /etc/hosts
```

The first thing to note is that if we press `<C-g>` to view the file status, Vim labels it as [readonly]. Vim won't prevent us from making changes to a readonly buffer, but it will prevent us from saving the changes to disk.

The remedy is this strange-looking command:

```
:w !sudo tee % > /dev/null
```

The :w !{cmd} sends the contents of the buffer as standard input to the specified {cmd}, which can be any external program.

`%` expands to represent the path of the current buffer, in this case `/etc/hosts`.
