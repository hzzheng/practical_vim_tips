## Delete Around, or Change Inside

1. tip

> Text objects usually come in pairs: one that acts inside the object and another that acts around the object.
> Vim's text objects fall into two categories: those that interact with pairs of delimiters, such as `i)`, `i"`, and those that interact with chunks of text, such words, sentences, and paragraphs.

As a general rule, we could say that the `d{motion}` command tends to work well with `aw`, `as`, `ap`, whereas the `c{motion}` command works better with `iw` and similar.
