# Tip 053

## Mark Your Place and Snap Back to it

1. tip

> Vim's marks allow us to jump quickly to locations of interest within a document. We can set marks manually, but Vim also keeps track of certain points of interest for us automatically.
> The `m{a-zA-Z}` command marks the current cursor location with the designated letter. Lowercase marks are local to each individual buffer, whereas uppercase marks are globally accessible.
> Vim provides two Normal mode commands for jumping to a mark. `'{mark}` moves to the line where a mark was set. The `\`{mark}`command moves the cursor to the exact position where a mark was set. The`mm` and \`m commands make a handy pair.Respectively, they set the mark m and jump to it.
