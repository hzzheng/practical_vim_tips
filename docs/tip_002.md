# Tip 002

## Don't Repeat Yourself

1. tip:

> `A` is the combination of `$a`, so we can use `A` to move the cursur to the end of line and enter insert mode meanwhile. To add `;` to the end of every line, we just type `A;` and `j.`.

2. snippet:

```js
var foo = 1
var bar = 'a'
var foobar = foo + bar
```
