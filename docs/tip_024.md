## Edit Tabular Data with Visual-Block Mode

1. tip:

> We can work with rows of text in any editor, but manipulating columns of text requires a more specialized tool. Vim provides this capability in the form of its Visual-Block mode, which we'll use to transform a plain-text table.

2. snippet:

```text
Chapter           Page
Normal mode         15
Insert mode         31
Visual mode         44
```

We can use `<C-v>3j` to select the space between two columns. then `x.` to reduce the space. And then press `gv` to reselect, `r|` to replace space with `|`, `yyp` to copy the first row, `Vr-` to replace the second copyed line. The result looks like:

```text
Chapter      |  Page
--------------------
Normal mode  |    15
Insert mode  |    31
Visual mode  |    44
```
