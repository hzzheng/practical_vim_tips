## Traverse the Change List

1. tip

> Vim records the location of our cursor after each change we make to a document. Traversing this change list is simple and can be the quickest way to get where we want to go.
> We can inspect its contents by running the following: `:changes`.
> Using the `g;` and `g,` commands, we can traverse backward and forward through the change list.

Vim automatically creates a couple of marks that complement the change list. The `\`.` mark always refereneces the position of the last change, while the `\`^` mark always tracks the position of the cursor the last time that Insert mode was stopped.

The `gi` command uses the `\`^` mark to restore the cursor position and then switches back into Insert mode. It's a great little time saver.

Vim maintains a change list for each individual buffer in an editing session. By contrast, a separate jump list is created for each window.
