## Repeat Line-Wise Visual Commands

1. tip:

> When we execute a commmand from Visual mode, we are dropped back into Normal mode and the range of text that was marked out in Visual mode is unselected. So What should we do if we want to perform another visual mode command on the same range of text? The answer: Dot command.

2. snippet:

```python
def fib(n):
  a, b = 0, 1
  while a < n:
print a,
a, b = b, a+b
fib(42)
```

Increase the indentation of while loop sentences. We can use `Vj`, then `>.` to indent the lines by two levels. `.` repeat the action.
