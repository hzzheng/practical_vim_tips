## Prefer Operators to Visual Commands Where Possible

1. tip:

> Visual mode may be more intuitive than Vim's Normal mode of operation, but it has a weakness: it doesn't always play well with the dot command. When a Visual mode command is repeated, it affects the same range of text. In this case, the original command (`vitU`) affected a word consisting of three lettersï¼Œ it falls short when we try re repeat the command on a word containing five letters.
> The Visual mode `U` command has a Normal mode equivalent: `gU{motion}`, in this case, we can use `gUit` instead.

2. snippet:

```html
<a href="#">one</a>
<a href="#">two</a>
<a href="#">three</a>
```

Make the words in `a` tag to Uppercase. We can use `gUit` instead of `vitU` which it not suitable in this case.

3. more:

Both of these techniques require only four keystrokes: `vitU` and `gUit`, but the underlying semantics are quite different. In the Visual mode approach, the four keystrokes can be considered as two separate commands: `vit` to make a selection and `U` to transform the selection. In contrast, `gUit` can be considered as a single command comprised of an operator(`gU`) and a motion (`it`).
