## Keep Your Fingers on the Home Row

1. tip

> I recommend that you look up the `:h motion.txt` section of Vim's documentation for a complete reference. Set yourself the goal of adding a couple of motions to your Repertoire each week.

2. more

Vim providers much quicker ways of moving around. You're wasting keystrokes if you press the `h` key more than two times in a row. When it comes to moving horizontally, you can get around quicker using word-wise or character search motions.

I us the `h` and `l` keys for off-by-one errros, when I narrowly miss my target. Apart from that, I hardly touch them. Given how little I use the `h` key, I'm happy to have to stretch for it on a Qwerty keyboard. On the flip side, I use the character search commands often, so I'm pleased that the `;` key rests comfortably beneath my little finger.
