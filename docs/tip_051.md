## Trace Your Selection with Precision Text Objects

1. tip

> Text objects allow us to interact with parentheses, quotes, XML tags, and other common patterns that appear int text.

2. snippet

```javascript
var tpl = ['<a href="{url}">{title}</a>']
```

Vim understands the structure of these well-formed patterns, and it allows us to operate on the regions of text that they delimit. Text objects define regions of text by structure.

| Text Object | Selection                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| a) or ab    | A pair of (parentheses)    |
| i) or ib    | Inside of (parentheses)    |
| a} or aB    | A pair of (braces)         |
| i} or iB    | Inside of (braces)         |
| a]          | A pair of {brackets}       |
| i]          | Inside of {brackets}       |
| a>          | A pair of <angle brackets> |
| i>          | Inside of <angle brackets> |
| a'          | A pair of 'single quotes'  |
| i'          | Inside of 'single quotes'  |
| a"          | A pair of "double quotes"  |
| i"          | Inside of "double quotes"  |
| a\`         | A pair of `backticks`      |
| i\`         | Inside of `backticks`      |
| at          | A pair of <xml>tags</xml>  |
| it          | Inside of <xml>tags</xml>  |

Visual mode makes for a nice introduction to text objects because it's easy to see what's happening. But text objects reveal their true power when we use them in Operator-Pending mode.

Remember this: whenever you see {motion} as part of the syntax for a command, you can also use a text object.
