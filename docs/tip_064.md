## Record and Excute a Macro

1. tip

>  Macros allow us to record a sequence of changes and then play them back.
>  Many repetitive tasks involve making multiple changes. If we want to automate these, we can record a macro and then execute it.
> The `q` key functions both as the "record" button and the "stop" button. To begin recording ur keystrokes, we type `q{register}`,giving the address of the register where we want to save the macro.


2. snippet

```javascript
foo = 1
bar = 'a'
foobar = foo + bar
```

Pressing `qa` begins recording and saves our macro into a register a. We then perform changes on the firstline: appending a semicolon and prepending the word var. Having completed both of those changes, we press `q` to stop recording our macro.

3. more

The `@{register}` command executes the contents of the specified register. We can also use `@@`, which repeats the macro that was invoked most recently.
