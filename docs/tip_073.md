## Use the \v Pattern Switch for Regex Searches

1. tip

The `\v` pattern switch allows us to use Vim's "very magic" regex syntax for searches. This is a very powerful feature that allows us to write very concise regex searches. They'are easier to remember than arbitrary rules about what must and must not be escaped.

```vim
#\([0-9a-fA-F]\{6}\|[0-9a-fA-F]\{3}\)

vs

\v#([0-9a-fA-F]{6}|[0-9a-fA-F]{3})
```
