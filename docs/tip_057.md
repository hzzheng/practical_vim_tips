# Tip 057

## Jump to the Filename Under the Cursor

1. tip
> Vim treats filenames in our document as a kind of hyperlink. When configured properly, we can use the `gf` command to go the filename under the cursor.
> The 'suffixesadd' option allow us to specify one or more file extensions, which Vim will attempt to use when looking up a filename with the `gf` command. We can set it up by running this command:
> `:set suffixesadd+=.rb`
> When we use the `gf` command, Vim checks each of the directories listed in 'path' to see if it contains a filename that matches the text under the cursor.
> We can inspect the value of the path by running this command: `:set path?`.

While jump list and change list are like breadcrumb trails that allow us to retrace our steps, the `gf` commands provide wormholes that transport us from one part of our codebase to another.
