## Save Files to Nonexistent Directories

1. tip

> Vim is happy to let us edit a buffer whose path includes directories that don't exist. It's only when we attempt t write the buffer to a file that Vim objects.

2. more

The `:edit {file}` command is most commonly used to open a file that already exists. But if we specify a filepath that doesn't correspond to an existing file, then Vim will create a new empty buffer.

If we press `<C-g>`, we'll see that the buffer is labeled as "new file". When we run the `:write` command, Vim will attempt to write the contents of that buffer to a new file using the filepath that was specified when the buffer was created. 

If we run `:edit {file}` and specify a filepath that contains nonexistent directories, things can get a little awkward.

We can remedy this situation by calling the external mkdir program:

```
:!mkdir -p %:h 
:write
```
