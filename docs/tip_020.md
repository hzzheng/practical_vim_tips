## Grok Visual Mode

1. tip:

> Many of the commands that you are familiar with from Normal mode work just the same in Visual mode. Some commands perform the same basic function as in Normal mode but with a slight twist. The difference is in how we specify the range on which to act. From Normal mode, we trigger the change command first and then specify the range as a motion. Whereas in Visual mode, we start off by making the selection and then trigger the change command.

2. snippet:

```js
// null
```

3. more:

there is a Select mode. we can toggle between Visual mode and Select mode by pressing `<C-g>`. If we type any printable character in Select mode, it will replace the selection and switch to Insert mode. Of course, from Visual mode you could just as well use the `c` key to change the selection.
