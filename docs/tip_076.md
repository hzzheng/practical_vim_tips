## Stake the Boundaries of a Word

1.  tip
    Some words, especially short ones, have a habit of showing up inside other words. For example, "the" appears in "there", "their", "them", and "then". If we want to search for "the", we don't want to match "there", "their", "them", and "then". We can use the `< and >` boundary switch to search for "the" only when it's a word by itself:

        :/\v<the> search for "the" as a word

It would find only one match in the excerpt.

These are zero-width items, meaning that they don't match any characters. They only match the position between characters. The `<` boundary switch matches the position between a word character and a non-word character.
