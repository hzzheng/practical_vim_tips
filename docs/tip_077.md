## Stake the Boundaries of a Match

1. tip

Sometimes we might want to specify a broad pattern adn then focus on a subset of the match. Vim's `\zs` and `\ze` switches allow us to do that.

An example would help ath this point. If we search for `/Practical Vim<CR>` then any occurrences of "Practical Vim" in the text will be highlighted. But what if we want to highlight only the word "Vim" in the text? We can use the `\zs` and `\ze` switches to do that:

    `:/Practical \zsVim<CR>` search for "Vim" in "Practical Vim"

The `\zs` switch marks the beginning of the match, and the `\ze` switch marks the end of the match. The text between the `\zs` and `\ze` switches will be highlighted. In this case, we want to highlight only the word "Vim", so we put the `\zs` and `\ze` switches around it.
