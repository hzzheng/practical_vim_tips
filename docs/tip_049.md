## Find by Characters

1. tip

> Vim's character search commands allow us to move quickly within a line, and they work beautifully in Oerprator-Pending mode.

| Command   | Move Cursor                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `f{char}` | Forward to the next occurrence of {char}                          |
| `F{char}` | Backward to the previous occurence of {char}                      |
| `t{char}` | Forward to the character before the next occurrence of {char}     |
| `T{char}` | Backward to the character after the previous occurrence of {char} |
| `;`       | Repeat the last character-search command                          |
| `,`       | Reverse the last character-search command                         |

In general, I tend use `f{char}` and `F{char}` in Normal mode when I want to move the cursor quickly within the current line, whereas I tend to use the `t{char}` and `T{char}` search commands in combination with `d{motion}` or `c{motion}`.

Take a look at the text that you're reading. It's composed almost entirely of lowercase letters. Capital letters are much raer, and so too are punctuation marks. When using the character search commmand, it's better to choose characters with a low frequency of occurrences. With practice you'll learn to spot them.
