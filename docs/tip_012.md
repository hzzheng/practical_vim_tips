# Tip 012

## Combine and Conquer

1. tip:

> Operator + Motion = Action. The `d{motion}` command can operate on a single character(`dl`), a complete word(`daw`), or en entire paragraph(`dap`). Its reach is defined by the motion. The same goes for `c{motion}`, `y{motion}`, and a handful of others.
> The combination of operators with motions forms a kind of grammar. The first rule is simpel: an action is composed from an operator followed by a motion. Learning new motions and operators is like learning th evocabulary of Vim. If we follow the simple grammar rules, we can express more ideas as our vocabulary grow.
> Vim's grammar has just one more rule: wen an operator command is invoked in duplicate, it acts upon the current line.
