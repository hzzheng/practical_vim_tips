# Tip 012

## Combine and Conquer

1. tip:

> We can minimize the keystrokes to perform certian taks by providing a count,but that doesnâ€˜t mean that we should. Counting is tedious. I'd rather hit the dot command six times than spend the same time looking ahead in order to reduce the number of keys that I have to press. Remember our mantra: act, repeat, reverse.

2. snippet:

change the following text to read 'Delete one word' instead.

```js
Delete more than one word.
```

You can use `2dw`,`d2w` or `dw.`, I prefer the last one.

3. more:

You'll develop your own opinion on this, depending on how much you value keeping your undo history clean and whether or not you find it tiresome to use counts.
