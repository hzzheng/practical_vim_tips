## Use Parentheses to Capture Submatches

1. tip

When specifying a pattern, we can capture submatches and then reference them elsewhere. This feature is especially useful in combination with the substitute command, but it can also be used to define patterns where a word is repeated.

2. more

```shell
/\v<(\w+)\_s+\1> search for repeated words
```

The above pattern will match any line that contains two words that are repeated. For example, the following line will match:

```shell
I love Paris in the
the springtime
```

`\1` is a reference to the first submatch, which is the word that is repeated.
