## Tab-Complete Your Ex Commands

1. tip:

> Just like in the shell, we can use the `<Tab>` key to autocomplete commands at the prompt.
> Vim is smart about picking suggestions for tab-completion. It looks at the context of what has already been typed at the command line and builds a list of suitable suggestions.For Example, we could type this: `:col<C-d>`. The `:col<C-d>` command asks Vim to reveal a list of possible completions. If we hit the `<Tab>` key, the prompt will cycle through colder, colorscheme, and then th original col again. We can scroll backward the suggestions by pressing `<S-Tab>`.

3.  more:

With the 'wildmenu' option enables, Vim provides a navigable list of suggestions.
We can scroll forward through the items by pressing `<Tab>`, `<C-n>`, and we can scroll backward through them with `<S-Tab>`, `<C-p>`.
