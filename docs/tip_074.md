## Use the \V Literal Switch for Verbatim Searches

1. tip

We can use the \V literal switch to search for verbatim strings. For example, if we want to search for the string "foo" in a file, we can use the following command:

    :/Va.k.a. search for "a.k.a." in a file

otherwise, we need to escape the dot:

    :/a\.k\.a\. search for "a.k.a." in a file

2. more

As Vim's documentation says, "use of \V means that in the pattern after it, only the backslash has a special meaning". This means that we can use the dot without escaping it.

Creating regular expressions is a very nomagic search is still possible, but it's awkward because we have to escape every symbol. As a general rule, if you want to search for a regular expression, use the \v pattern switch, and if you want to search for verbatim text, use the \V literal switch.
