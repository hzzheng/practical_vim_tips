## Duplicate or Move Lines Using ':t' and ':m' Commands

1. tip:

> The `:copy` command (and its shorthand `:t`) lets us duplicate one or more lines from one part of the document to another, while the `:move` command lets use place them somewhere else in the document.
> `:6copy.`, the [range] was line 6. `.` was our {address}, which stands for the current line. So We can read the `:6copy.` command as "Make a copy of line 6 and put it below the current line." We could use the `:t` as a synonym.
> `:m` stands for move line. `'<,'>m$` means move the selection to the end of the file.
