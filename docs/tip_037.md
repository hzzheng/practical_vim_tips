# Tip 037

## Group Buffers into a Collection with the Argument List

1. tip

> The argument list is easily managed and can be useful for grouping together a collection of files for easy navigation. We can run an Ex command on each iterm in the argument list usesing `:argdo` command.
> We can type `:args` to print the argument list which represents the list of files that was passed as an argument when we ran the vim command.
> When the :args Ex command is run without arguments, it prints the contents of the argument list. We can also set the contents of the argument list using this form `:args {arglist}`.
> The simplest way of populating the argument list is by sepecifyinig filenames one by one: `args index.html app.js`, but we can use glob matching as well.

2. snippet

file/.charpters

```txt
the_vim_way.pml
normal_mode.pml
insert_mode.pml
visual_mode.pml
```

```bash
:args `cat .charpters`
```

Vim executes the text inside the backtick characters in the shellï¼Œ using the output from the cat command as the argument for the `:args` command.


3. more:

With the `:args {arglist}` command, we can clear the argument list and then repopulate it from scratch with a single command. We can traverse the files int the argument list using `:next` and `:prev` commands.
