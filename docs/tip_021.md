## Define a Visual Selection

1. tip:

> Vim has three kinds of Visual mode: character-wise、line-wise、block-wise。We can press `v` by itself to enable character-wise Visual mode. Line-wise Visual mode is enabled by pressing `V`, and block-wise Visual mode by pressing `<C-v>`.

| Command | Effect                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `v`     | Enable character-wise Visual mode   |
| `V`     | Enable line-wise Visual mode        |
| `<C-v>` | Enable block-wise Visual mode       |
| `gv`    | Reselect the last visual selection  |
| `o`     | Go to other end of highlighted text |
