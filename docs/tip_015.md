## Paste from a Register Without Leaving Insert Mode

1. tip:
   Vim'yank and put operations are usually executed from Normal mode, but sometimes we might want to paste text into the document without leaving Insert mode.

2. snippet:

```text
Practical Vim, by Drew
Read Drew Neil's
```

complete the last line by inserting the title of this book. We can 'yt,' to copy the title from first line, then `jA` to jump to the end of second line, finally `<C-r>0` to paste the text.

1. more:

The `<C-r>{register}` command is convenient for pasting a few words from Insert mode.
