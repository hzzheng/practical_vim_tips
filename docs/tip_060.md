## Grok Vim's Registers

1. tip

> Rather than using a single clipboard for all cut, copy, and paste operations, Vim provider multiple registers. When we use the delete, yank, and put commands, we can specify which register we want to interact with.
> The delete, yank, and put commands all interact with one of Vim's registers. We can specify which register we want to use by prefixing the command with `"{register}`. If we don't specify a register, then Vim will use the unnamed register.
> For example, if we wanted to yank the current word into register a, we could run `"ayiw`.
> Vim has one named register for each letter of the alphabet.

When we use the `y{motion}` command, the specified text is copied not only into the unnamed register but also into the yank register, which is addressed by the 0 symbol.

When we address a named register with a lowercase letter, it overwrites the specified register, whereas when we use an uppercase letter, it appends to the specified register.

The black hole register ia a place from which nothing return. If we run the command "_d{motion}", then Vim deletes the specified text without saving a copy of it.

If we use the cut or copy command to capture text in an external application, then we ca paste it inside Vim using "+p command. Conversely, if we prefix Vim's yarnk or delete commands with "+, the specified text will be captured in the system clipboard.
