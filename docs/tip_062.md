## Paste from a Register

1. tip

> The `p` command puts the text from a register after the cursor position. As a complement, Vim also provides the `P` command, which inserts text before the cursor position.

2. more

From Insert mode, we can insert the contents of the unnamed register by pressing `<C-r>"`, or we can insert the contents of the yank register by pressing `<C-r>0`.

Vim also provides `gp` and `gP` commands. These also put the text before or after the current line, but they leave the cursor positioined at the end of the pasted text instead of at the beginning.
