## Snap Between Files Using Global Marks

1. tip

> A global mark is a kind of bookmark that allows us to jump between files. Marks can be especially useful for snapping back to a file after exploring a code base.
> The `m{letter}` command allows us create a mark at the current cursor position. Lowcase letters create marks that are local to a buffer, whereas uppercase letters create global marks. Having set a mark, we can snap our cursor back to it with the '\`{letter}' command.

Advice is rarely welcome when it goes "You should have started by doing X". Global marks are only userful if we have the forethought to set them up correctly in advance. With practice, you'll learn to recognize the scenarios where it would be useful to set a global mark.

Remember, you can set up to twenty-six global marks, which is more that you'll ever need. Use them liberally: set a global mark any time you see something that you might want to snap back to later.
