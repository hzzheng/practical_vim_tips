# Tip 035

## Run Commands in the shell

1. tip

> We can easily invoke external programs without leaving Vim. Best of all, we can send the contents of a buffer as standard input to a command or use the standard output from an external command to populate our buffer.
> For example, if we want examine the contents of the current directory, we could run the following: `:!ls`.
> On Vim's command line, the % symbol is shorthand for the current file name. We can exploit to run external commands that do something with the current file. For example, If we're working on a Ruby file, we could execute it by running this: `!ruby %`.
> We can press `C-z` to suspend the process that's running Vim and returns control to bash. In bash, we can use the `fg` to resume a suspended job, bringing it back into the foreground.
