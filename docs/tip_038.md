# Tip 038

## Manage Hidden Files

1. tip

> When a buffer has been modified, Vim gives it sepecial treatment to ensure that we don't accidentally quit the editor without saving our changes. 
> If we modify a buffer, but not save the buffer yet, when we switch to the next buffer, Vim will raises an error message, reporting that the current buffer contains unsaved changes. We can use `:bnext!` to force Vim to swtich buffers.
> And if we run the `:ls` command now, the modified buffer will be marked `h` that represents `hidden`.
