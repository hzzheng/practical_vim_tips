## Tune the Case Sensitivity of Search Patterns

1. tip

We can tune the case sensitivity of Vim's search globally or on a per-seach basis.

2. more

We can override Vim's default case sensitivity by using the `\c` and `\C` modifiers. `\c` makes the search case insensitive, and `\C` makes it case sensitive. For example, `/\cfoo` will match `foo`, `Foo`, `FOO`, etc. and `/\Cfoo` will match only `foo`.

Vim provides a global option, `ignorecase`, which controls the default case sensitivity of searches. If `ignorecase` is set, then searches are case insensitive by default. If `ignorecase` is not set, then searches are case sensitive by default.

Vim provides an extra setting that makes an effort to predict the case sensitivity of searches. If `smartcase` is set, then Vim will make the search case sensitive if the search pattern contains an upper case letter. For example, `/\cfoo` will match `foo`, `Foo`, `FOO`, etc. and `/\Cfoo` will match only `foo`. However, `/\cFoo` will match only `Foo` and `/\CFoo` will match only `Foo`.
