## Act Upon a Collection of Files

1. tip 
> So far, we've stuck to tasks that were repeated in the same file, but we can play back a macro across a collection of files. Once again, we'll consider how to execute the macro in parallel and in series.

2. more

If we record a macro, then we can execute the macro in all of the buffers in the argument list:

:argdo normal @a

We can also append the `:next` command to the macro to excute in series.

Then we can run `:wall` or `:argdo write` to save all files in the argument list.
