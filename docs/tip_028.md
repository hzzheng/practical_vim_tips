## Append After a Ragged Visual Block

1. tip:

> Many Ex commands can be given a [range] of lines to act upon. We can specify the start and end of a range with either a line number, a mark, or a pattern.
> `:1` stands for jump to the start of the file. `:2,5p` stands for printing content of line 2 to line5.
> `.,$p` stands for printing from current line to end of the file.
> The `'<` symbol is a mark standing for the first line of the visual selection, while `'>` stands for the last line of the visual selection.\* > `.,.+3`, the . symbol stands for the current line, so `.,.+3` is equivalent to `:2,5` in this case.
