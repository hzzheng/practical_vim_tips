## Run Normal Mode Command Across a Range

1. tip:

> If we want to run a Normal mode command on a series of consecutive lines, we can do so using the `:normal` command.
> To demonstrate, we'all append a semicolon at the end of each line of file.

2. snippet:

```js
var foo = 1
var bar = 'a'
var baz = 'z'
var foobar = foo + bar
var foobarbaz = foo + bar + baz
```

Firt, `A;<Esc>` to append a semicolon to the end of first line.
Then, `jVG` to select all other lines.
Andï¼Œ`:'<,'>normal .` to execute the Normal mode `.` command on each line which appends a semicolon to each line.

3.  more:

We can also use `:%normal A;` commmand do the same thing. `%` symbol is used as range representing the entire file.

We can use `:%normal i//` to comment out entire Javascript file.

We noted that Ex commands can change multiple lines at once. The `:normal` command allows us to combine the expressive nature of Vim's Normal mode commands with the range of Ex commands.

It's really a powerful combination!
