## Meet Vim's Command Line

1. tip:

> When we press the `:` key, Vim switches into Command-Line mode. This mode has some resemblance to the commmand line that we use in the shell. We can type the name of a command and then execute it by pressing `<CR>`. At any time, we can switch from Command-Line mode back to Normal mode by pressing `Esc`.
> For historical reasons, the commands that we execute from Command-Line mode are called Ex commands. Command-Line mode is also enabled when we press `/` to bring up a search prompt or `<C-r>=` to access the expression register.

2. more:

`ed` was the original Unix text editor. It was written at a time when video displays were uncommon. It went through several generations of improvements, including `em`, `en`, and Eventually `ex`. By this time, video displays were more common. `ex` added a feature that turned the terminal screen into an interactive window that showed the contents of a file. Now it was possible to see changes as they were made in real time. The screen-editing mode was activated by entering the `:visual` command, or just `:vi` for short. And that is where the name `vi` comes from.

Vim stands for `vi improved`.
