## Insert Unusual Characters by Character Code

1. tip:

> Vim can insert any character by its numeric code. This can be handy for entering symbols that are not found on the keyboard.
> We can tell Vim to insert any arbitrary character if we know its numeric code. From Insert mode, we just have to type `<C-v>{code}`, where {code} is the address of the character that we want to insert.

2. snippet:

```js
// null
```
