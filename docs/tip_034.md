## Recall Commands from History

1. tip

> Vim keeps a history of our activity in Command-Line mode. We can easily recall previous commands, so there's no need to type out a long Ex command at the prompt more than once.
> To begin with, let's switch to Command-Line mode by pressing the `:` key. Leave the prompt empty; then press the `<Up>` key. Then command line should be populated with the most recent Ex commands that we executed. We can use the `<Up>` key again to go further back through our Ex command history or use the `<Down>` key to go in the opposite direction.
> As Well as recording a history of Ex commands, Vim keeps aseparate record of our search history. If we press `/` to bring up the search prompt, we can also scroll backward and forward through previous searches with the `<Up>` and `<Down>` keys.
> By default, Vim records the last twenty commands. With memory becoming ever cheaper in today's computers, we can probably afford to up this limit by changing the `history` option. Try adding this line to your vimrc: `set history = 200`.
