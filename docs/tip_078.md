## Escape Problem Characters

1. tip

The `\V` literal switch makes it easier to search for text verbatim because it disables the special meanings for .,+,and \* symbols, but there are a few characters whose special meaning can't be turned off.

Suppose that we want to search for all instancess of the URL http://vim-doc.net/search?q=/\\. Rather than typing it out in ful, we'll just yank it into a register so that we can paste it into our search field. We want to match this text exactyly as it is, so we'll use the `\V` literal switchã€‚

With our cursor placed anywhere inside the brackets, we can yank the URL into register `u` with the commmand `"uyi[`, We the type `\V<C-r>u<CR>` to populate the search filed with the contents of that same register.

When searching forward, we have to escape `/` characters.

When searching backward, we have to escape `?` characters.

There's one more character that we have to escape: the backslash itself. If we want to search for a backslash, we have to escape it with another backslash. For example, if we want to search for the string `\\`, we have to type `\\\\`.
