## Track Open Files with the Buffer List

1. tip

> Vim lets us work on multiple files at the same time. The buffer list lets us keep track of the set of files that we've opened in the course of an editing session.
> Files are stored on the disk, whereas buffers exist in memory. When we open a file in Vim, its contents are read into a buffer, which takes the same name as the file. Most Vim commands operate on buffers, but a few operate on files.

2. more:

We can open a few files by running commands like: `vim *.txt`. Then press `:ls` to see the buffer list. We can use for commands: `:bprev`„ÄÅ`:bnext` to move backward and forward on at a time, and `:bfirst` and `:blast` to jump to the start or end of the list. Or We can quickly toggle between the current and alternate files by pressing `<C-^>`.
