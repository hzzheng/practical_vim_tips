## Repeat the Last Ex Command

1. tip:

> While the `.` command can be used to repeat our most recent Normal mode command, we have to use `@:` instead if we want to repeat the last Ex command.
> We could type this command once: `:bnext`, Then we use `@:` to repeat the command.

2.  more:

We could run `:bnext` once and then repeat it as often as we like using the `@:` command. If we needed back up, we could do so using `<C-o>` command. Then, if we wanted to continue going forward through the buffer list, we could go back to using the `@:` command.
