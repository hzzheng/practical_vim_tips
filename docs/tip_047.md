## Distinguish Between Real Lines and Display Lines

1. tip

> Unlike many text editors, Vim makes a distinction between real lines and display lines. When the 'wrap' setting is enabled, each line of text that exceeds the width of the window will display as wrapped, ensuring that no text is truncated from view. As a result, a single line in the file may be represented by multiple lines on the display.

Understanding the difference between real and display lines is important because Vim provides motions for interacting with both kinds.

Note the pattern: `j`, `k`, `0`, and `$` all interact with real lines, while prefixing any of these with `g` tells Vim to act on display lines instead. For example, `gk` move up by display lines.
