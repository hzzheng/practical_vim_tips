## Open a File by Its Filepath Using ':edit'

1. tip

> The `:edit` command allows us to open files from within Vim, either by specifying an absolute or a relative filepath.
> When Vim is launched, it adopts the same working directory that was active in the shell. We can confirm this by running the `:pwd` Ex command, which stands for "print working directory".
> The `:edit {file}` command can accept a filepath relative to the working directory.
> We can use the tab key to autocomplete these filepaths.
> We can also open a file relative to the active file directory. The Ex command is `:edit %:h<Tab>`.
> The `%` symbol is a shorthand for the filepath of the active buffer. The `:h` modifier removes the filename while preserving the rest of the path.

Besides working nicely with `:edit`, `%:h` can come in handy with other Ex command such as :write, :saveas, and :read.
