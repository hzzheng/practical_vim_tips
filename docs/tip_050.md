## Search to Navigate

2. more

We're not llimited to using the search command in Normal mode. We can use it from Visual and Operator-Pending modes just as well to do real work. For example, suppose that we wanted to delete the text "takes time but eventually" from this phrase:

```
This phrase takes time but eventually gets to the point.
```

To begin with, we press `v` to switch to Visual mode. Then we can extend the selection by searching for the short "get" string. The selection includes the "g" at the start of the word, but we don't want to delete that. We'll use `h` to back up one character. Then, having defined our selection, we'll delete it with the `d` command.

We can do the same thing quickly by commands `d/ge{CR}`.

It takes a bit of getting used to, but combining the `d{motion}` operator with the search motion is a power move.
