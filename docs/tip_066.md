## Play Back with a Count

1. tip

> The Dot Formula can be an efficient editing strategy for a small number of repeats, but it can't be executed with a count. Overcome this limitation by recording a cheap one-off macro and playing it back with a count.

2. snippet

```javascript
x = "("+a+","+b+","+c+","+d+")";
```

We can approach this in exactly the same way. But when we have to invoke the two commmands `;.` so many times to complete the job, it starts to feel like a lot of work.

We can simulate this by recording one of the simplest possible macros: `qq;.q`. Here, `qq` tells Vim to record the following keystrokes and save them to the q register. Then we type our commands `;.` and finish recording the macro by pressing `q` one final time. Now we can execute the macro with a count: `11@q`. This executes `;.` eleven times.
