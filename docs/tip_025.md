## Change Columns of Text

1. tip:

> We can use Visual-Block mode to insert text into serveral lines of text simultaneously. Visual-Block mode is not just useful to us when working with tabular data. Oftentimes, we can benefit from this feature when working with code.

2. snippet:

```text
li.one   a { background-image: url('/images/sripte.png'); }
li.two   a { background-image: url('/images/sripte.png'); }
li.three a { background-image: url('/images/sripte.png'); }
```

Suppose that `sprite.png` file has moved from `images/` into `componnets/` directory. We'll need to change each of these lines to reference the file's new location.

Use Visual-Block to define the selection, then use `c` to change directory.
