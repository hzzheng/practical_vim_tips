# Tip 009

## Compose Repeatable Changes

1. tip:

> In Vim, we always have more than one way of doing something. In evaluating which way is best, the most obvious metric is efficiency: which technique requires the fewest keystrokes. But how should we pick a winner in the event of a tie?

2. snippet:

Suppose that our cursor is positioned on the "h" at the end of this line of text, and we want t delete the word "nigh".

```text
The end is nigh
```

solution 1: `db` + `x`, vim golf is 3.gg
solution 2: `b` + `dw`, vim golf is still 3.
solution 3: `daw`, vim golf is 3 as well.

3. more:

Tie-breaker: which is most repeatable. `daw` does something truly useful, it will repeat the instruction to delete a word. It invests the most power into the dot command, so I declare it the winner of this around.
