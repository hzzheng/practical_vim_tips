## Jump Between Matching Parentheses

1. tip

> Vim provides a motion that let us move between opening and closing pairs of parentheses.
> The `%` command lets us jump between opening and closing sets of parentheses. It works with (), {}, and [].
> When we use the `%` command, Vim automatically sets a mark for the location from which we jumped. We can snap back to it by pressing `\`\``.

Vim ships witha plugin called `matchit`, which enhances the functionality of the `%` command. When this plugin is enabled, the `%` command can jump between matching pairs of keywords. For example, in an HTML file, the `%` command would jump between opening and closing tags.

One of mye favorite plugins is surround.vim, which makes wrapping a selection with a pair of delimiters easy.

`S"` can be read as "Surround the selection with a pair of double quote marks", We could just as easily use `S)` or `S}`.

We can also use surround.vim to change existing delimiters. For example, we could change {London} to [London] with the `cs}]` command, which can be read as "Change surrounding {} braces to [] brackets".
