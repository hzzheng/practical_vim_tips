# Tip 070

## Evaluate an Iterator to Number Items in a List

1. tip 

Being able to insert a value that changes for each execution of a macro can be useful. Suppose that we want to create a numbered list from a series of items on adjacent lines. To demonstrate, we'll start with this text:

```
partridge in a pear tree
turtle doves
French hens
calling birds
golden rings
```
We'll transform it to look like this:

```
1) partridge in a pear tree
2) turtle doves
3) French hens
4) calling birds
5) golden rings
```

2. more

Record the macro:

1. :let i=1;
2. qa
3. I<C-r>=i<CR>
4. <Esc>
5. :let i+=1 
6. q

Excute the macro:

1. jVG
2. :'<,'>normal @a
