# Tip 055

## Traverse the Jump List

1. tip

   > Vim records our location before and after making a jump and provides a couple of commands for retracing our steps.
   > Vim provides a similar feature by way of the jump list: the `<C-o>` command is like the back button, while the complementary `<C-i>` command is like the forward button.
   > motions move around within a file, whereas jumps can move between files.
   > As a rule of thumb, we could say that long-range motions may be classified as a jump, but short-range motions are just motions.
