## Append After a Ragged Visual Block

1. tip:

> Visual-Block mode is great for operating on rectangular chunks of code such as lines and columns, but it's not confined to rectangular regions of text.

2. snippet:

```js
var foo = 1
var bar = 'a'
var foobar = foo + bar
```

Commands: `<C-v>jj$`, `A`.
