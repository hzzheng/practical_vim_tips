## Repeat a Change on Contiguous Lines

1. tip 

> We can make light work out of repeating the same set of changes on a range of lines by recording a macro and then playing it back on each line. There are two ways to do this: executing the macro in series or in parallel.

2. snippet

```
1. one
2. two
3. three
4. four
```

We'll make it look like this:

```
1) One 
2) Two 
3) Three 
4) Four 
```

`qa` to start the marco recording. `0f.` to find the period. `r)` to replace the period with `)`. Then `w~` to uppercase the first character.

3. more

We can execute the macro we just recorded by pressing `@a`. We could invoke the `@a` command three times to complete the task, but running `3@a` is quicker.

Executing a macro on multiple items in parallel is more robust. In this scenario, it's the better solution. But if we raise an error when we execute a macro, maybe we want those alarms to go off. Executing a macro on multiple items in series makes it clear when and where any errors occur.
